** Compiler adventure

Attempt to solve exercises from very old compiler book for newbies.

Link to the book:
Let's Build a Compiler, by Jack Crenshaw
https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/

It's seems to be very easy book achually.

| Compiler        | TurboPascal  | clang / any modern |
| Target Assembly | 68000        | Atmel AVR  / avra  |
